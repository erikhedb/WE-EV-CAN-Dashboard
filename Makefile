# Usage:
#   make build        # Build all binaries and UI with assets
#   make build-core   # Build only core binaries (reader, handler, replay)
#   make build-tools  # Build only tool binaries
#   make build-ui     # Build UI binary and copy static assets
#   make ui           # Alias for build-ui
#   make test         # Run all Go tests
#   make lint         # Run linter (requires golangci-lint)
#   make clean        # Remove all built binaries
#   make <binary>     # Build individual binary (e.g., make reader)
